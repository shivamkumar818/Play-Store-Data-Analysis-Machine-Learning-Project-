📊 Project Workflow
Data Loading: Load CSV data into a pandas DataFrame.

Data Cleaning: Handle wrong data types, remove duplicates, and fix missing values.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualize key patterns using histograms and boxplots.

Feature Engineering: Apply label encoding to categorical features.

Model Training: Use Random Forest Classifier to predict app categories/ratings.

Model Evaluation: Analyze the model's performance using precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy.

🎯 Key Outcomes
Cleaned and prepared real-world messy data.

Developed a robust machine learning model for classification.

Extracted valuable business insights from app metrics.
